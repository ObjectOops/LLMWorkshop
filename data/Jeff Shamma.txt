BiographyJeff S. Shamma is with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he is the Department Head of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering (ISE) and Jerry S. Dobrovolny Chair. His prior academic appointments include faculty positions at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he was the Julian T. Hightower Chair in Systems and Controls. Jeff received a PhD in Systems Science and Engineering from MIT in 1988. He is a Fellow of IEEE and IFAC; a recipient of the IFAC High Impact Paper Award, AACC Donald P. Eckman Award, and NSF Young Investigator Award; and a past Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Control Systems Society. He has been a plenary or semi-plenary speaker at several conferences, including NeurIPS, World Congress of the Game Theory Society, IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, and the American Control Conference. Jeff was the Editor-in-Chief for the IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems from 2020-2024. His research focuses on decision and control, game theory, and multi-agent systems.
