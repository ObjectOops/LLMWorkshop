Teaching StatementThere is no doubt that teachers possess tremendous power to make a difference in the lives of their students. An effective, inspiring teacher can promote interest in the subject, while a less effective one can completely discourage students from pursuing a discipline. A good teacher is very passionate about the subject and should be able to explain complex concepts to students concisely, making them accessible even to someone new to the field. They should also demonstrate to students the applicability of gained knowledge to address real world challenges, as well as to benefit student’s future career goals. Finally, a good teacher should create a trusted atmosphere to make students comfortable asking any questions. I firmly believe that effective communication is key to helping students achieve their highest potential.
As a teaching faculty member at UIUC, I follow this teaching philosophy when instructing students in a range of courses, from sophomore-level required classes such as ECE210 (analog circuits and systems) to more advanced elective and capstone courses like ECE330 (power circuits and electromechanics), ECE333 (green electric energy), and ECE445 (senior design). My aim is to assist students in discovering their interests and career paths by presenting various facets of electrical and computer engineering in a manner that is straightforward to comprehend.
