Professional Highlights
Research Center: I am the UIUC PI of a Joint Center for mRNA Delivery and Cancer Immunotherapy that has recently been funded.  Its primary goal is to establish a new UIUC-ZJU joint research center for messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery and cancer immunotherapy under the broad theme of Engineering Sciences for Human Health.  It involves a collaborative team of 8 faculty investigators in 4 academic departments involving UIUC, ZJU main campus, ZJUI (Haining), and ZJU-Edinburgh (Haining), with broad expertise in bioengineering, materials science, chemical and biological engineering, cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  
Recent Awards and Recognitions: I received the “Lifetime Achievement Award in Nanomedicine” (2018) from the Chinese American Society of Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology (CASNN), in recognition of my long-lasting contributions to bionanotechnology and nanomedicine. I was also recognized as one of “Giants of Nano” based on a Power List of International Analytical Scientists (2017). During the last 5 years, I have also nominated a number of faculty colleagues in BIOE, ECE, materials science, and chemistry for awards and recognitions, leading to at least 4 UIUC faculty members being elected and recognized by the American and International Institutes of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE and IAMBE).

Scholarship: During the last 5 years (since 2017), my group has published 52 papers and patents (averaging about 10 papers per year) including a high-profile perspective article in Nature Materials and an original research article in Science Translation Medicine. According to Google Scholar, my scholarly work has been cited 27,566 times during the last 5 years (since 2017). Overall, my scholarly papers have cited more than 85,000 times with an h-index of 105. Among these papers, 16 of them have each been cited more than 1000 times. Also, I was ranked as one of most cited and influential scientists in the world for both 2018 and 2019.
