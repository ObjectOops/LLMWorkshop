BiographyEric Kuo received bachelor's degrees in physics and mathematics from Brandeis University in 2008. After a brief stint teaching high school physics, he began his graduate work at the University of Maryland, where he received his Ph.D. in physics in 2013. After working as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University and as a research associate at the University of Pittsburgh, he joined the physics department at Illinois in 2020. Professor Kuo takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of teaching and learning, drawing on research in other fields, such as the learning sciences, psychology, and cognitive science, to study the dynamics of learning and to develop models of how physics students think. He applies these models to tackle a broad range of issues related to physics education, with a strong focus on mathematical reasoning, causal reasoning, and problem solving. 
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesI'm always looking to work with undergrad and grad students interested in physics education research.  If you'd like to discuss possible opportunities or have any questions, please send me an email.  Students working with me can expect to gain a background in theories of learning and quantitative/qualitative methodologies for examining physics education.  My research team welcomes individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and ideas who embrace and value diversity and inclusivity.
