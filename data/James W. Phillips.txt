Research StatementProfessor Phillips has conducted research in the area of biomechanics, publishing one of the first studies on the aging effect in silicone-gel breast implants. He developed a simple but effective load cell for measuring the axial force and twisting moment in wire ropes, such as those used in deep-shaft mines. He also used the then newly-developed pulsed-ruby laser in a photoelastic analysis of mechanical pulse propagation in curved beams.Professor Phillips oversees testing on the 3 million-pound testing machine in Talbot Laboratory, as well as the machine's calibration to standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
