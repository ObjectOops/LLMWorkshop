BiographyProfessor Jack Mochel received his bachelor's degree in physics from Cornell University in 1961 and his PhD in physics from the University of Rochester in 1966. He joined the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois in 1966 and has enjoyed a distinguished research and teaching career.Â 

He has supervised twenty-one Ph.D. students and has made major contributions to high-temperature superconductivity, superconductivity in amorphous metals, and third-sound resonance in thin He films. Most recently, Professor Mochel served the Department as Associate Head for Graduate Programs (1994-1999). He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society.
Research Interests
Condensed matter experiment, low temperature physics, He thin films, high temperature superconductivity, electron microscopy, and physics of nanometer metal clusters.
