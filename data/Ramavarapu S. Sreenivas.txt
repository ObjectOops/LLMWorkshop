Education
Ph.D., Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, 1990
M.S.E.E.		Elec. & Comp. Engr.		Carnegie Mellon		1987
B.Tech		Electrical Engr.		Indian Inst. of Tech.		1985

BiographyI received a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, (IIT) Madras, India in 1985. I was at the IIT, Madras from 1980-1985. I have an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. I was at Carnegie Mellon between 1985 and 1990. I then moved to Harvard University, where I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Decision and Control at what was then the Division of Applied Sciences. After a two-year stint at Harvard, I came to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I am a Professor with the Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering Department. I hold research appointments at the Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL) and the Information Trust Institute (ITI). I am also an affiliate of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, and an Arthur Davis Faculty Scholar at the University of Illinois. 
Academic Positions
Research Professor, Information Trust Institute
Research Professor, Coordinated Science Lab
Departmental Affiliate, Electrical & Computer Engineering
Professor, Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering
Postdoctoral Fellow, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 1990-1992
Research Assistant, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 1985-1990

Teaching StatementAt the undergraduate level, I have instructed various courses in the controls curriculum for the Systems Engineering & Design Program, including SE320: Introductory Control Systems, SE420: Digital Control of Dynamic Systems, SE423: Introduction to Mechatronics, and SE424: State Space Design Methods in Control. I have also advised multiple projects within the industry-sponsored Senior Engineering Project sequence (SE494: Senior Engineering Project I and SE495: Senior Engineering Project II).

Moving onto graduate education, I have taught advanced courses in both the Controls and Industrial Engineering curricula in the College. These include AE555: Multivariable Control Design, SE525: Discrete Event Systems, IE511: Integer Programming, and IE531: Algorithms for Data Analytics.

Since its inception in May 2006, I have been an integral part of the Master of Science in Financial Engineering (MSFE) Program at our university. This Cross-College Program involves faculty from multiple colleges, including Engineering and Business. Within this program, I have taught IE523: Financial 
Computing. The MSFE program is currently ranked 4th among FE-Programs nationally.

Additionally, I have collaborated on the instruction of HT503: Hardware Engineering for Health Technology and HT 504: Software Engineering for Health Technology within the Health Technology (HT) program at UIUC.

I have been recognized for my excellence in teaching twenty-five times across various courses, and in 2023, I was awarded the UIUC Campus Award for Excellence in Graduate and Professional Teaching.

Research StatementMy current research focus lies in the comprehensive analysis, control, and performance evaluation of a wide category of systems referred to as  Discrete-Event/Discrete-State (DEDS) systems in the literature. These systems are prominent in various domains such as air-traffic control, automated manufacturing, computer networks, integrated command, control, communication and information (C3I) systems, and operations management of complex organizations with event-driven dynamics like shipyards, airports, hospitals, etc.To address the unique challenges posed by DEDS systems, I employ the theories of Computation, Coding, Machine Learning, Approximate Algorithms, Online Algorithms, and Information Theory. By leveraging these advanced methodologies, I develop near-optimal supervisory policies tailored to various problems within the realm of DEDS Systems.
