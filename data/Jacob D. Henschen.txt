Teaching StatementMy primary focus at Illinois will be the modernization of the curriculum, where we will be implementing new strategies and an alternative course structure to enhance the graduate and undergraduate educational experience. The goal is to prepare our graduates to be more effective and innovative in their work -- teaching ability or research. In addition, I plan to continue technical research on the rheological behavior of cementitious materials for 3D printing applications. I will also continue to develop uses of waste and recycled materials as additives in concrete.
Research Interests
Pedagogical development of faculty
Additive manufacturing with cementitious materials
Near peer mentoring in engineering education


Research Areas
Construction Materials
Structural Engineering
