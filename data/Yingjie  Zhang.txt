Research StatementThe Zhang group study complex interfaces and molecular systems, with the goal of: 1) understanding the fundamental atomic and molecular scale processes at solid-liquid interfaces, such as dynamic solvation, electrochemical energy conversion, and catalysis; 2) deciphering the structure, distribution, and function of various small molecules in liquid electrolytes and biological systems; and 3) bringing solutions to the society, in areas of renewable energy and healthcare.Our research is highly interdisciplinary, spanning over areas of physical/materials/analytical chemistry, condensed matter physics, chemical engineering, and mechanical/electrical engineering. We are always looking for motivated graduate students, postdocs, and undergrads to join us.
