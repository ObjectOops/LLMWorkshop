Other Scholarly Activities
One of two founding members of the COVID-19 modeling team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The team developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemics on the UIUC campus. This model was used to advise the university leadership on testing frequency, scheduling, and mitigation measures such as, e.g., a temporary ban on student parties.
One of two founding members of the COVID-19 modeling team for the office of the Governor of Illinois. Between April 2020 and July 2021, the modeling team provided weekly modeling predictions such as the likelihood to exceed hospital capacity in each of the 11 regions of the state.
