Research StatementProfessor Dantzig's most significant contributions in materials science and engineering research are in the area of computational modeling of solidification processes and microstructure development. He uses advanced computational methods to model the evolution of microstructure during solidification, a problem that involves multiple length and time scales. He has helped lead the use of adaptive grid methods to resolve the various length scales, and this work has led to a better understanding of dendritic growth. His most recent work in this area extends this approach to the study of phenomena that span the range of length scales from atomic to mesoscopic.He was one of the first scholars to develop mathematical models of stress, fluid flow and heat transfer to predict and control materials processing operations. He was also a leader in applying optimization techniques coupled to these analytical methods to provide models that actually improve processes.Professor Dantzig has recently taken an interest in biological systems. He and his research group model the interaction of cells with an advancing solidification front to determine the conditions that lead to successful cryopreservation of cell suspensions. They use the level set method to track the evolving interface and models for the van der Waals and drag forces on arbitrarily shaped surfaces to solve on an adaptive grid. He is also working with MechSE Professor Iowona Jasiuk to investigate the flow of fluids through bone under applied loads. This work may lead to a better understanding of the transport of nutrients and the role of microstructure in bone remodeling.
