BiographyBrent Heuser is a Professor in the Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering Department at the University of Illinois.  He has been a member of the UIUC faculty since 1994.  His research interests involve nuclear materials, hydrogen phase behavior in metals, and the application of advanced neutron scattering techniques, X-ray scattering, and microanalytical analysis techniques to materials research.  He currently has research projects related to irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking of LWR structural alloys, corrosion and fission gas behavior in molten salts for advanced reactor concepts, and accident tolerant LWR fuel (doped urania) and cladding (coatings on Zr-based alloys).  Experimental facilities in his laboratory include a reactive-gas magnetron sputtering facility dedicated to physical vapor deposition of metal and ceramic coatings for nuclear materials research, a recirculating loop autoclave with a 50kN load frame for LWR immersion studies, a static FLiNaK molten salt corrosion/sparging apparatus, a NETZSCH Jupiter simultaneous thermal analyzer, a Zeiss optical microscope with DIC capability, and HV two Sievert’s systems for hydrogen loading.
