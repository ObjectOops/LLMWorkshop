Research StatementProfessor Tortorelli conducts research leading to the theoretical development, computer implementation, and application of design and analysis methodologies in solid mechanics, structures, heat transfer and fluid mechanics. He investigates design sensitivity analyses and their applications in optimization, and uses the sensitivities to solve inverse heat conduction problems, both transient and steady-state, linear and nonlinear.He developed a systematic methodology for evaluating sensitivity expressions for numerical analysis. The methodology has been implanted in finite element programs to optimize a variety of engineering systems and manufacturing processes, including crystal growth, casting, welding, polymer extrusion and polymer injection molding. It has also been used to solve inverse and identification problems. He is exploring various applications in structural optimization. He has applied these methods to design a photonic crystal waveguide termination and more effective controllers.Professor Tortorelli is the technical co-director of the Midwest Structural Sciences Center, a partnership among the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the Air Force Institute of Technology and the Air Vehicles Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory. The center is focused on simulating, modeling, testing and assessing airframe structures and materials critical to the future of the nation's aerospace program. Research on aerothermostructures centers on four key areas: coupled thermo-mechanical-acoustic analysis and simulation, identification and definition of structural limit states, risk-quantified structural assessment, and experimental capabilities for validation of structural models. Professor Tortorelli's research specifically addresses imperfection and defect tolerance of aircraft shells and structures.
