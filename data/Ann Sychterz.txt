BiographyAnn Sychterz(SICK-tesh) obtained her PhD in 2018 from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) addressing the novel use of control algorithms, statistical diagnostic tools, and real-time feedback on a full-scale tensegrity structure to enable smooth deployability, damage detection, adaptation, and learning. During her masters of applied science obtained in 2014 at the University of Waterloo, she built full-scale aluminum pedestrian bridges for vibration characterization and control. She completed a postdoctoral position at the University of Michigan on actuator optimization of adaptive origami structures. With her team at Sychterz Modular Adaptive Resilient Transformable Infrastructure (SMARTI) lab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, they harness geometrically nonlinear systems, such as tensegrity structures and origami, for adaptive civil infrastructure. She is a faculty affiliate with Mechanical Science and Engineering, faculty fellow of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and a faculty affiliate of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology in the Autonomous Materials Systems group.

Teaching StatementTeaching Statement: I have developed much about my teaching philosophy through discussions at the ASCE ExCEEd teaching workshop, mirroring the traits of my teaching mentors, and through teaching swing dancing across the world for 15 years. Learning to assess the engagement of the students, I tailor delivery of my lessons through the type of media used, verbal and visual cues, and level of detail. In teaching swing dancing and civil engineering, I spend time on the structure of my lessons such that the beginning, end, and take away message are very clear. To ensure that students of all levels understand at least the general concepts, I employ the use of an analogy or concept with broad, medium, and fine level of detail.

Research StatementResearch Statement: My research seeks to create new lightweight, adaptive, and deployable structures with innovative control and machine learning techniques to address changing environmental challenges as it applies to structural engineering design, efficiency, and resilience. A structure that can self-identify damage, adapt, and learn for developing infrastructure systems that provide safety and continuous functionality even when subjected to extreme loading conditions.  Resiliency and reserve capacity for strength and stiffness in this work will be addressed through changing the shape and stiffness of a structure. The increasing frequency of intense weather and environmental changes from climate change are driving the need for adaptive structural systems.
