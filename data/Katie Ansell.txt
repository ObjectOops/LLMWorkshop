BiographyProfessor Ansell received her BS in physics and music from the University of Michigan in 2008, and completed her PhD at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2020.  While working on her PhD, she developed a new curriculum for Physics 211 labs that fosters the development of creativity and independent thinking, supported by practical and procedural experimental skills. This new curriculum has grown to include the algebra- and calculus-based Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism courses, as well as leading to the growth of a Learning Assistant program in the Physics department and improved efforts for Teaching Assistant professional development.Her current work in Physics Education Research focuses on understanding social and cognitive aspects of how groups of students learn to work together, and how instructors, near-peers, and students navigate the ecosystem of introductory physics labs. As Teaching Faculty, she also applies principles from cognitive science, instructional design, and education theory to her teaching practices in large introductory courses.
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesProfessor Ansell has openings for undergraduates familiar with the introductory Physics curriculum who are interested in exploring social, emotional, and identity-related aspects of being in introductory physics classes. Project responsibilities may include video recording, transcribing, and analysis; collection and analysis of large-scale survey data; or working with student focus groups to evaluate curriculum changes.
