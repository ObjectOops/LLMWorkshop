ECE/NE 410 Neural Circuits and Systems


Course Development
2024 (Spring semester) I developed new learning materials (including new lecture slides, classroom games, and graduate project reading materials) for UIUC ECE/NE 410 Neural Circuits and Systems. I also added a field trip for students to visit Illinois Carle Neural Engineering and Rehabilitation Engineering to learn brain and muscle signal measurements.  The frontiers of relevant research and real-world examples were also introduced in the classroom activities of this course to link the knowledge with state-of-the-art research and applications. Health disparity issues in neurological disorders have been discussed to enhance DEI principles in course teaching. 
2022 (Spring semester) I created and taught the University of Oklahoma Biomedical Engineering graduate course "Neural System and Rehabilitation Engineering" (OU code: BME 5970, 3 EC). This new course teaches advanced knowledge of neural control of movement, the musculoskeletal system, and movement impairment and disability. We discuss the frontiers of rehabilitation engineering including assistive technologies, brain-computer interfaces, regenerative rehabilitation, and machine learning in rehabilitation. The course also teaches writing skills for NIH/AHA aims page for research projects in the field of rehabilitation engineering. The gender and geographical disparity issues in rehabilitation engineering have been discussed in the course via literature review and classroom discussion.  

2020 - 2023 (Fall semester) I made pedagogical innovation to the University of Oklahoma Biomedical Engineering undergraduate course "Bioelectricity" (OU code: BME 3133, 3 EC): the infusion of CDC and AHA data for heart-related bioelectricity provides an inspiring real-world connection; Link the knowledge to the application by providing demos, videos, short research paper reading in the class; Classroom activities to allow every student to give a short presentation at the end of the courses. Health disparity issues in cardiovascular diseases have been discussed to enhance DEI principles in course teaching.
