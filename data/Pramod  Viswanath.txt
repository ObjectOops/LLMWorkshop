Research StatementMy area of research is Wireless Communication Networks. My main research interests are in understanding fundamental limitations to reliable wireless communication and to leverage this understanding into engineering solutions for wireless networks. An important component of my research is to take a system view of wireless communication by a joint consideration of networking and medium access issues with the underlying time-varying wireless channel.More broadly, I am interested in understanding fundamental limitations to network information transmission and representation. Some of our recent research resolves decades-long open problems in optimal network information compression.My publications provide a finer look at the nature of my research interests and the engineering scope of contributions.
