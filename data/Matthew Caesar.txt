Research Interests
Simplifying management and improving reliability of distributed systems and networks through principles of self-organization and self-diagnosis, with an emphasis on wide-area networks and networked systems.
My research focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of distributed systems and networks on the extremely large scale, with an emphasis on network operations, measurement, and availability. I am particularly interested in improving availability and performance of the Internet infrastructure, including routing, DNS, and data centers.
