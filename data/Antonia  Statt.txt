Research StatementOur lab’s research focuses on understanding fundamental phenomena in soft matter systems, motivated by challenges in energy, environment, and technology. We are particularly interested in crystallization and aggregation of polymers and colloidal systems, and non-equilibrium effects like flow or evaporation. Our work integrates empirical model development, statistical mechanics, applications of machine learning techniques, and highly efficient GPU-accelerated simulations. 
Graduate Research OpportunitiesWe are always looking for motivated, excited graduate students! If you are at UIUC, please send a short description of your research interests and background to us, and some times to meet. For graduate students at other institutions, you might be able to do an internship at our group if you have external funding or a fellowship, please send a brief description of your background and interests and the contact details of your primary research advisor. For applying to grad school at UIUC, please find all relevant information on our department webpage. 
Undergraduate Research Opportunities If you are interested in joining the lab please send us an email, describing background, research interests, what you hope to get out of your research experience, and how much time you want to spend in the lab. You don’t need any previous research experience, just be motivated and curious to learn! International students may be able to join our lab if you have funding, either with an REU program or external fellowships.
