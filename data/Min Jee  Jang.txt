Research Interests
As a principal investigator at UIUC Bioengineering, my vision is to pioneer cutting-edge technologies for targeted, non-invasive genetic access to specific types and states of brain cells. Despite significant progress in mapping the diverse landscape of brain cell types based on their gene expression profiles, we have yet to fully understand (1) what the unique role of this genetically defined cell type in brain function and disease is, (2) which cell types should be targeted to achieve desired functional outcomes, and (3) how this “cell type” inferred from transcriptomic snapshots is related to the dynamic nature of the brain. Advances in genetic toolkits, including systemic AAVs we developed, have addressed some critical challenges in tackling those questions by enabling the delivery of molecular tools, such as optical actuator and sensors, or gene-editing tools, to the brain of the living animals. However, our current ability for genetic access to the brain has profoundly limited due to the lack of cell-type specificity and temporal resolution. Leveraging my unique combination of expertise in viral vector engineering and spatial transcriptomics, my laboratory will aim to better understand the genetic and
epigenetic programs governing brain cell types and dynamics and, with the knowledge we gained, to develop new gene delivery toolkits that enable efficient, specific, and programmable expression of transgenes in the targeted cell types and states. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to deepening our fundamental understanding of brain’s working mechanism at genetic levels and transforming our technologies into personalized genetic medicine for neurological and psychiatric disorders.
