BiographyMinje Kim is an associate professor in the Dept. of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is also an Amazon Visiting Academic, working at Amazon Lab126. Before then, he was an associate professor at Indiana University (2016-2023). He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science at UIUC (2016). He worked as a researcher at ETRI, a national lab in Korea, from 2006 to 2011. He received his Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at POSTECH (Summa Cum Laude) and in the Division of Information and Computer Engineering at Ajou University (with honors) in 2006 and 2004, respectively. During his career as a researcher, he has focused on developing machine learning models for audio signal processing applications. He has been on more than 60 patents as an inventor.

Research StatementMinje Kim has focused on improving the efficiency and scalability of machine learning models for audio applications. He developed model compression methods that use fewer computing resources for on-device processing, proposed the “personalization” concept that scales down the task to focus on specific users’ voices, and scalable model architectures that adapt to the dynamically changing resource constraints. These algorithms have been successfully used to solve various audio problems, such as signal enhancement, source separation, speech and audio compression, spatial audio, etc.
