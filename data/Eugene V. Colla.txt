Research StatementInvestigations of highly disordered ferroelectric materials (relaxors). Relaxors are widely used in different applications due to their unique properties, but there is no comprehensive understanding of the physical nature of these properties. Study of dielectric and pyroelectric properties of such relaxors as PMN, PMN-PT, PLZT etc. Study of phase transitions and other properties of nanosize scale objects.
