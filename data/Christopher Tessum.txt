BiographyDr. Christopher Tessum joined the CEE department as an Assistant Professor in January 2020. His research focuses on modeling air pollution and its health impacts, quantifying inequities in the distribution of those impacts, and proposing and testing solutions. He studies the relationships between emissions, the human activities that cause them, and the resulting health impacts, and he develops modeling capabilities to enable these types of analyses. Before joining UIUC, Dr. Tessum was a research scientist in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle and a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering at the University of Minnesota. He received a Ph.D. (2014) in Civil, Environmental and Geo- Engineering, and a B.M.E. in Mechanical Engineering (2006), from the University of Minnesota.
Academic Positions
Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (January 2020 - present)
Research Scientist, University of Washington, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (March 2016 - May 2019)
Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Minnesota, Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering (January 2015 - March 2016)

Research StatementAmbient air pollution causes ~4% of total deaths in the United States, more than three times the number caused by motor vehicle crashes. Tessum's research assesses air pollution-related effects of human activity, focusing on mechanistic modeling of outdoor air pollution and its health impacts, quantifying inequities in the distribution of those impacts, and proposing and testing solutions. He studies the relationships between emissions, human activities that cause them, and the resulting health impacts, and he develops modeling capabilities to enable these types of analyses.
