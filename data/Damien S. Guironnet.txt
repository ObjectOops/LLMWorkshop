Research StatementThe research in our group lies at the interface of polymer science and catalysis. Our approach is multidisciplinary and involves a diverse array of techniques. The impact of our research is expected to fall within the domains of materials science and green chemistry. Overall, we are designing new catalysts and catalytic processes to transform bio-based and oil-based feedstocks into valuable chemicals and to develop new sustainable polymerization techniques. Projects in my group include 1) the development of new processes for the production of important chemicals from abundant raw materials, 2) the design of new methods for the synthesis of end-functionalized and amphiphilic polymers, and 3) the synthesis of new catalysts for the insertion (co)polymerization of polar monomers.
Research Interests
Polymer synthesis, organometallic chemistry and catalysis
