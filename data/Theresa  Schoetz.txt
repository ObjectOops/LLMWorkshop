Research StatementThe research in our group focuses on the development of electrochemical materials and interfaces for next-generation batteries and supercapacitors that can be integrated in modern electronics shaping today’s societies by making our world more connected, safer, and cleaner. Our scientific philosophy is to identify, understand, and control the molecular-level phenomena that govern macroscopic material properties, charge storage mechanisms, mass transport processes and device performance using a variety of electrochemical, spectroscopy and microscopy methods. Our distinct expertise lies in the advanced application and analysis of electrochemical methods, e.g., variable-rate cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), chronoamperometry and in-operando techniques such as electrogravimetry (EQCM) and electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM). Reconfigurable shape-morphing batteries that take electrochemical interfaces in energy storage systems far beyond their current state-of-the-art design space are of particular interest. Our fundamental electrochemical background and experience allow us to transfer and connect knowledge across different research areas ranging from energy storage and conversion, (bio)sensors, photoelectronics, and AI hardware.
