Research StatementMy research trajectory in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering is driven by a forward-thinking approach to advancing technology and fostering collaboration between academia and industry. As a research professor, I am particularly drawn to the mission of the Illinois Plasma Institute (IPI), an initiative of the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The founding principles of the IPI resonate deeply with my own goals, as it seeks to reimagine traditional pathways to technology commercialization by creating a collaborative environment where academic researchers and industrial partners can work together closely. This collaborative model allows for a transition from laboratory research to production-level implementation, ultimately shortening the time to adoption in high-volume manufacturing. My experience within the semiconductor industry has reinforced the importance of such collaborative initiatives. Working on research and development projects related to memory deposition tools and artificial intelligence, I've witnessed firsthand the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge sharing between academia and industry.
