BiographyProfessor Draper received his PhD in Physics from The University of Chicago in 2011 following his BS from the University of Illinois in 2005. He held postdoctoral appointments at the University of California Santa Cruz and the University of California Santa Barbara and a faculty appointment at the University of Massachusetts Amherst before moving to the University of Illinois in 2018. He works on a variety of topics in theoretical high energy physics and early-universe cosmology.
Research StatementMuch of my research has been motivated by the electroweak hierarchy problem and the strong CP problem. I have worked on the physics of the Higgs boson, particularly in the context of supersymmetric solutions to the hierarchy problem; the cosmology of axion solutions to the strong CP problem and other axion-like dark matter candidates; and the experimental probes of other mechanisms that could address strong CP. I am also interested in more theoretical aspects of quantum field theory, particularly regarding nonperturbative phenomena in gauge theories, and in constraining effective field theories with ultraviolet consistency conditions.
