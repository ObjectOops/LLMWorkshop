BiographyBassem Andrawes is a Professor of Structural Engineering in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He is the Director of the US DOT-funded Transportation Infrastructure Precast Innovation Center (TRANS-IPIC). Prof. Andrawes is a licensed professional engineer and an elected Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). He received his B.Sc., MS, and Ph.D. all in Civil Engineering from Ain Shams University, Iowa State University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology, respectively. Before joining the University of Illinois in 2006, Professor Andrawes worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California Irvine and as a Design Engineer in California at the Englekirk Partners Consulting Structural Engineers. Prof. Andrawes has over 28 years of experience as an engineer, educator, and researcher in earthquake engineering and infrastructure resilience and durability. He is known for his pioneering work in the emerging application of shape memory alloys (SMAs) in civil infrastructure. He teaches classes at the University of Illinois on the design and behavior of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures and the design of highway bridges.
