BiographyDr. Kontou is an assistant professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her research focuses on sustainable and electrified transportation systems planning and management. She received her Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University of Florida, her MSc from Virginia Tech, and a Diploma from the National Technical University of Athens. She was a postdoctoral research associate at the Transportation and Hydrogen Systems Center of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the City and Regional Planning Department of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is a member of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Committee on Alternative Fuels and Technologies (AMS40) and the past Chair of TRB’s Young Members Coordinating Council. She is a 2023 NSF CAREER awardee, a 2023 Council of University Transportation Centers (CUTC)-Cambridge Systematics New Faculty Award recipient, a 2022 Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant Faculty Scholar, a 2021 US Frontiers of Engineering invited participant, and a Levenick Sustainability Teaching Fellow at the University of Illinois. She is an Associate Editor of the Transportation Research Part D journal and an Early Career Advisory Board member of Transportation Research Part C journal. She serves on the Steering Committee of the Illinois Alliance for Clean Transportation.
