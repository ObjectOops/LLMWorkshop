BiographyFor the past 32 years, Leon Liebenberg has been deeply involved in engineering teaching, research, and community engagement. He is currently a Teaching Professor in the Department of Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Leon is also Associate Director of the Grainger College of Engineering's interdisciplinary Master of Engineering (Energy Systems) Program, which draws around 50 master's students a year.
Before joining UIUC’s Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering in 2017, Leon worked as a higher education consultant in Lausanne, Switzerland, for three years. Prior to that, he was a full professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Pretoria and the North-West University in South Africa.
Leon is passionate about multidisciplinary research, particularly in engineering education, energy engineering, and biomedical engineering. His university research has focused on developing industrial energy-efficient technologies and cancer therapies using energy restriction methods, as well as creating novel pedagogies of engagement. However, his first love is teaching.
At UIUC, he founded the strategic instructional innovations program called ENGINE (ENgaGement In eNgineering Education). He collaborates with 20 faculty members and graduates from various disciplines to explore the relationship between pedagogies of engagement, cognition, and emotion, aiming to better understand how to engage students more fully in their learning, reflection, and testing of ideas.
In 2021, Leon co-founded and coordinated the Sustainability Competition for Undergraduate Students, which annually attracts around 300 participants from 11 international universities, including those in the University of Illinois System. The competition employs the guided self-study approach that Leon also uses in his graduate classes.
Leon teaches a variety of subjects, including Energy and Sustainability Engineering, Energy and Security, Energy Conversion Systems, Heat Transfer, Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, Advanced Heat and Mass Transfer, Innovation, Statics, Dynamics, Thermodynamics, Fluid Dynamics, Automatic Control Systems, Design for Manufacturability, and Mechanical Design.
Leon Liebenberg holds a diploma in advanced mechanical engineering from the University of London, a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London, and bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Johannesburg. As of October 2024, Leon Liebenberg’s research papers have an h-index of 33. ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0834-6212
