BiographyDr. Marvin R. Paulsen was born in Minden, Nebraska and earned a bachelor's and a master's degree in Agricultural Engineering from the University of Nebraska in 1969 and 1972, respectively. Paulsen then attended Oklahoma State University, where he received a Ph.D. in Agricultural Engineering in 1975. Upon graduation, Dr. Paulsen joined the Department of Agricultural Engineering at the University of Illinois. Paulsen's research focused on grain quality - understanding what degrades grain quality and how to protect against that degradation. Paulsen was involved extensively in grain quality measurements. His research on the breakage of corn during export shipment made significant contributions to the state of Illinois and to the U.S. grain trade. His results provided information used by importers, merchandisers, and corn geneticists to improve handling methods and corn characteristics. Paulsen was also involved with the use of machine vision to detect grain kernel defects and later with near-infrared reflectance/transmission (NIR/NIT) spectroscopy to predict starch extractability of corn samples. His research in the use of NIR/NIT to measure corn starch extractability and other quality traits, proved of great benefit to the corn merchandising industry. Professor Paulsen developed an international expertise in grain quality measurements and effects of drying, handling and transport on quality changes. He has given numerous presentations on U.S. grain quality in Europe, China, Russia, and for the U.S. Grains Council for conferences in Japan, Columbia, Peru, and Mexico. In 2002, he was elected to Fellow in ASABE, and in 2005 he received the Paul A. Funk Recognition Award from the College of ACES. Paulsen became Division Leader of Food and Bioprocess Engineering in May of 1989, serving until July of 2006. He was appointed Graduate Program Director for the Department from 1994 to 1996 and 1997 to 2006. He created the first Graduate Program Handbook in 1999 and revised it each year. Paulsen served as the Associate Head of the Department from August 2000 until his retirement in July of 2006.
