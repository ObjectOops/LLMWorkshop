Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Agricultural & Industrial Safety and Health, Jan 2020 - Present 

Research Interests
Dr. Issa's research is focused on injury prevention through predictive algorithms, evaluating new technologies and implementing technologies that reduce or remove hazards.  Recognizing that agriculture ranks among the deadliest occupations with injury rates remaining fairly stable since 1990's, he is exploring new strategies in training, and prevention. One of his focus areas is in testing solutions to handle out of condition issues facing grain handling and storage industry with the aim or reducing grain entrapments. His extension program focuses on agricultural injury trends in Illinois and promoting a culture of safety among Illinois farmers and workers.
