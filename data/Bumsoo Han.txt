BiographyBumsoo Han is a Professor of Mechanical Science and Engineering and Materials Research Laboratory, and Phil & Ann Sharp Scholar in Cancer Research. Prior to joining the University of Illinois, he has been a Professor or Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical engineering at Purdue University. He was also a Program Leader of the Drug Delivery and Molecular Sensing Program of the NCI-designated Purdue Institute for Cancer Research. He received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Minnesota and his MS and BS from Seoul National University in Korea. After his PhD, he was a Postdoc Fellow in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. He received US DOD Postdoctoral Award for Breast Cancer Research, NSF CAREER Award, US AFOSR Faculty Fellowship (Predictive Toxicology), and Richard Skalak Best Paper Award from the ASME Journal of Biomechanical Engineering. In addition, he is a Fellow of ASME and B.S.F. Schaefer Outstanding Young Faculty Scholar of Purdue. He also receives the Faculty of Excellence Early Career Research Award from Purdue and the Brain Pool Korea Fellowship from the National Research Foundation of Korea.
