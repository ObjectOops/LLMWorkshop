Teaching StatementProfessor Oelze is interested in teaching wave propagation, acoustics, ultrasonic imaging, electromagnetics, biomedical imaging and mentoring students in research activities.
Research StatementProfessor Oelze has three thrusts of his research all based on ultrasound: Imaging, therapy, and devices. For imaging, Prof. Oelze is using quantitative ultrasound techniques with applications in breast cancer and identifying the response of patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. He is working with clinical and industry partners to develop these technologies. Prof. Oelze has developed nonlinear beam formation strategies, called null subtraction imaging (NSI), which allows the creation of B-mode images for larger pitch arrays without grating lobes. NSI also can provide super resolution imaging. Prof. Oelze has applied these super resolution imaging techniques to imaging the microvasculature with or without contrast agents. Prof. Oelze has developed beam visualization techniques to observe the therapy beam for focused ultrasound applications in real time. Prof. Oelze is working with collaborators from across campus to develop mechanophores that are activated by ultrasound and capable of producing therapeutic effects at depth. Prof. Oelze is working on small implantable devices that are powered by and controlled by ultrasound imaging. He has developed techniques that can stream high definition (4k) video through tissues.     
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesSeveral projects are available for undergraduate research including the use of coding schemes to enhance ultrasonic imaging capabilities, devising improved measurement and calibration techniques for ultrasonic imaging, and quantifying materials using ultrasound. Students involved in these research opportunities will learn to characterize and calibrate ultrasonic sources, process data, and develop important laboratory skills.
