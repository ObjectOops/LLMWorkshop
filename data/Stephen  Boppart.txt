BiographyStephen Boppart is a Professor and Grainger Distinguished Chair in Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with appointments in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Bioengineering, the Carle Illinois College of Medicine, and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology.  His Biophotonics Imaging Laboratory is focused on developing novel optical biomedical diagnostic and imaging technologies and translating these into clinical applications.  Prof. Boppart received his Ph.D. in Medical and Electrical Engineering from MIT, his M.D. from Harvard Medical School, and specialty training in Internal Medicine.  He has published over 475 invited and contributed publications, delivered over 1000 invited and contributed presentations, and has over 55 patents related to optical biomedical imaging technology.  He has mentored over 200 interdisciplinary undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate researchers.  He was recognized by MIT Technology Review magazine as one of the Top 100 Young Innovators for his development of medical technology, and with the Paul F. Forman Engineering Excellence Award from Optica for dedication and advancement in undergraduate research education.  He received the international Hans Sigrist Prize in the field of Diagnostic Laser Medicine, the IEEE Technical Achievement Award, and the SPIE Biophotonics Technology Innovator Award.  Prof. Boppart has co-founded four start-up companies to commercialize and disseminate his optical technologies for biomedical imaging and was recently elected a member of the National Academy of Inventors.  He is also a Fellow of AAAS, IEEE, OSA, SPIE, AIMBE, BMES, and IAMBE.  He established and served as Director of Imaging at Illinois, a university-wide program to integrate imaging science, technology, and applications across multiple modalities and fields, and is currently Director of the GSK Center for Optical Molecular Imaging, supported by an academic-clinical-industry partnership with GlaxoSmithKline.  In support of a national NIH Biomedical Technology Research Resource, Prof. Boppart is directing the recently awarded NIBIB P41 Center for Label-free Imaging and Multiscale Biophotonics (CLIMB).  Prof. Boppart has been a strong advocate for the integration of engineering, technology, and medicine to advance human health and our healthcare systems.  He played an active role in the initiation, visioning, launch, and growth of the new engineering-based Carle Illinois College of Medicine at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and served as Executive Associate Dean and Chief Diversity Officer.  Currently he is serving as the Director for the university’s Interdisciplinary Health Sciences Institute, and as the Illinois Co-Chair of the Mayo Clinic & Illinois Alliance for Technology-Based Healthcare.  Through all these efforts he is recognized for developing new programs for research and education in technology-inspired health innovation.

Teaching StatementProf. Boppart's teaching activities and interests are highly interdisciplinary, following his research activities. Teaching activities cover cross-cutting areas in engineering, medicine, and biology. Courses have included ECE/BioE 414 and 415, Biomedical Instrumentation lecture and laboratory, ECE 460 Optical Imaging, ECE 380 Biomedical Imaging, and ECE 467 Biophotonics. For each of these, courses are taught relating fundamental engineering and scientific principles to real-world applications. Students participate directly with state-of-the-art information exchange by performing literature searches and preparing classroom presentations of journal articles about techniques and technologies discuss in lecture. Concepts are reinforced by use of stimulating discussions centered around clinical scenarios. For example, students in ECE 380 Biomedical Imaging are randomly given a medical beeper than when called for an "emergency", are presented with clinical medical images and scenarios that call on their ability to apply course principles to diagnose technical problems in the imaging data or systems. Students complete these courses having a broad-based knowledge of these subjects, and key tools for further in-depth investigations and advanced study.
Research StatementMy interdisciplinary research group combines the fields of engineering, medicine, and biology to develop novel optical biomedical imaging technologies and translate these for biological discovery and clinical applications. Biophotonics, the application of light in medicine, biology, and biotechnology applications, enables us to develop innovative technologies to detect disease at early stages, when it is most amenable to treatment.
Post-Doctoral Research OpportunitiesThe Biophotonics Imaging Laboratory at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has an immediate opening for a post-doctoral research associate in the area of nonlinear optical imaging systems for biomedical applications. Headed by Prof. Stephen Boppart, the Biophotonics Imaging Laboratory is a dynamic and productive interdisciplinary research and training environment focused on developing novel optical biomedical imaging technologies, translating them into clinical applications, and driving them toward commercialization for improving healthcare.
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesThere is a long history of undergraduate research opportunities in Prof. Boppart's Biophotonics Imaging Laboratory. Over the last 25 years, over 85 undergraduate students have conducted research in Prof. Boppart’s laboratory, often leading to an undergraduate thesis. Research areas cover aspects of optical imaging and physics, signal and imaging processing, image acquisition systems, biomedical optics and biophotonics, laser and optical source development, and clinical imaging applications. Undergraduate research experiences typically extend over two or more semesters, and result in the completion of an undergraduate thesis and a departmental symposium presentation. Exceptional research has been published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national conferences.
