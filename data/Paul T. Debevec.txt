BiographyProfessor Paul T. Debevec received his bachelor's degree in physics from  Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968 and his Ph.D. in physics from  Princeton University in 1972. He joined the Department of Physics at the Indiana  University as an assistant professor in 1974 after working as a research  associate at Argonne National Laboratory. He came to the University of Illinois  in 1977 as an associate professor and was promoted to full professor in  1983.
Professor Debevec has worked extensively on a multi-institutional experiment  at Brookhaven National Laboratory to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of  the muon, which will sharpen the congruity between theoretical predictions and  experimental results that form a cornerstone of the standard model. A key  contribution was his development of the microstrip gas chamber to measure the  number and direction of electrons flying from decaying muons.
Research StatementAs a collaborator in BNL E812, the g–2 experiment, my group is responsible for the measurement of the stored muon distribution. We have designed and built a compact system of drift chambers to track the decay electrons to determine the parent muon distribution. The convolution of this distribution and the precision field map is the field which precesses the muons. This quantity and the precession frequency together determine g–2. With our expected precession, we have an unambiguous test of the standard model and its extensions. The techniques developed in the g–2 experiment are leading us to a new measurement of the muon lifetime. The Fermi coupling constant, one of three fundamental constants of the standard model, is obtained from the muon lifetime.
