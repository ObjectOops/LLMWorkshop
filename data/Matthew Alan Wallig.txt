Research Interests
Dr. Wallig's professional interests include studying the potential synergy that exists between bioactive compounds found in cruciferous vegetables (e.g. broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage) and the prevention of cancer. Dr. Wallig also has numerous collaborative projects related to the chemopreventive effects of phytochemicals with faculty in several other departments including Nutritional Sciences, Food Science & Human Nutrition and Natural Resources & Environmental Sciences.  Among those projects are the effects of grapeseed extract on the prevention of colon cancer, green teas and their prevention of liver cancer, and glucosinolate derivatives from broccoli and their effects on prevention of a variety of cancers.  In addition, he collaborates on projects defining the effects of fructose on lipid metabolism, dietary fiber and infant formulas and their impacts on neonatal gut development and the influence of exercise on tumor growth and development.  Dr. Wallig is also Residency Coordinator for Anatomic Pathology and Advisor for the Student Chapter of the ACVP.
