Research Interests
The overarching theme of my research is to understand and manipulate microbial systems at the molecular level for beneficial applications towards environmental sustainability. Our research is at the interface of environmental engineering and molecular and synthetic biology, with interests in: 1) Renewable biocatalysis for water reclamation and reuse, 2) Waste-to-energy/value biotransformation and resource recovery, and 3) Disease control to protect public health
