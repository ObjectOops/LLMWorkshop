BiographyDr. Zhou earned his B.S. with High Honors in Materials Science and Engineering with a minor in Chemistry from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He continued his graduate study in the same department and earned his Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering in 2019 under the guidance of Professor Charles M. Schroeder. During his Ph.D., he used single-molecule techniques to study polymer dynamics and self-assembling materials. He made a transition in his research direction into optical bioelectronics during his postdoc time at Stanford University Department of Chemistry and Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute with Professor Bianxiao Cui. His current research is at the interface of soft materials and biology where he uses ultrasensitive optical detection tools to understand the fundamental electrophysiological processes in brain and heart.
