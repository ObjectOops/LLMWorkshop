BiographyDakshita Khurana is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Her research focuses on cryptography and its interactions with quantum information. She has made several contributions to secure protocol design, including to succinct and zero-knowledge proof systems, non-malleable protocols and secure computation. Her work has also utilized cryptographic hardness to improve our understanding of other aspects of theoretical computer science, e.g., by establishing the hardness of finding Nash equilibria under standard lattice assumptions. Her research enabling secure computation from weak cryptographic structure in the quantum regime was invited as one of the (long) plenary talks at QIP. Her research has also been recognized via invitations to the SIAM Journal on Computing, awarded to selected papers at STOC and FOCS.
 Dakshita is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award, Google Research Scholar award, Visa Research faculty award, and a Graduate of Last Decade (GOLD) Alumni award from IIT-Delhi. In addition, her work has been funded through grants and gifts from the NSF, AFOSR, DARPA, C3AI and Jump Arches. She was named to Forbes List of 30 under 30 in Science and awarded a Google Research Fellowship at the Simons Institute, Berkeley. Her thesis work was previously recognized with a UCLA Dissertation Year Fellowship, a UCLA CS Outstanding PhD Student Award and Outstanding Graduate Awards from Symantec and CISCO.
