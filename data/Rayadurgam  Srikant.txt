BiographyR. Srikant is one of two co-Directors of the C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute, a Grainger Distinguished Chair in Engineering, and Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Coordinated Science Lab.  His research interests include machine learning, applied probability, stochastic control, and communication networks. He is the recipient of the 2015 INFOCOM Achievement Award, the 2019 IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and  Communications Award and the 2021 ACM SIGMETRICS Achievement Award. He has also received several Best Paper awards including the 2015 INFOCOM Best Paper Award,  the 2017 Applied Probability Society Best Publication Award, and the 2017 WiOpt Best Paper award. He was the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking from 2013-2017 and is currently an Area Editor for the Mathematics of Operations Research. More than twenty of his former advisees are on the faculty of top universities in the US and around the world, and the rest are in leadership or R&D positions in leading companies.
