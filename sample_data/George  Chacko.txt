CS 598: Computational Scientometrics

Research StatementMy scientific interests are presently centered around community finding techniques that inform understanding the structure of research communities that form around scientific questions. These interests are linked to novelty in science, knowledge diffusion, and peer review. A related interest is the social interactions that drive scientific recognition and achievement. Over the last four years, I have retreated from a pronounced  scientometric focus to a more nuanced view that involves greater effort on method development. Accordingly, emphasis in my work is placed on discovery and evaluation in the background of the need for improved and more scalable methods. I do not have an interest in commonplace global metrics such as the h-index and its well documented limitations.  My research interests are complemented by my responsibilities in research analytics at the Grainger College of Engineering. Other (more informal) descriptions of my interests and outlook on research can be found here and here. 
The techniques used in my studies build upon work in prior work in scientometrics, computer science, and the history of science among other disciplines. 
CS 597 offerings: I am willing to offer CS 597 courses for current PhD or MS students at UIUC who are looking for potential thesis topics. The research I can advise on is presently focused on clustering, community detection. community search with application to the real world problems of science mapping, research evaluation, and scientometrics. A key part of the group experience is developing the ability to critically interpret the literature relevant to our interests. Students are expected to develop their verbal and written communication skills.
