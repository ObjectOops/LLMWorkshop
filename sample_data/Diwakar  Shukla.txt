BiographyDiwakar Shukla is an associate professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is also an affiliate faculty in the Center for Biophysics and Quantitative biology, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, Department of Plant Biology and Department of Bioengineering. His research work is focused on understanding the complex biological processes using novel physics-based models and techniques. He started his research career at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India, where he received B. Tech and M. Tech. degrees in chemical engineering. He then joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering for his work on solution biochemistry with Prof. Bernhardt Trout. Before joining Illinois, he worked with Prof. Vijay Pande at Stanford University on developing distributed computing approaches for understanding protein dynamics. Shukla has received numerous early-career faculty awards from the American Chemical Society, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. At Illinois, Shukla has been recognized for his research and teaching: he has been awarded the Dean’s Award for excellence in research (2020, 2024); named a Lincoln Excellence for Assistant Professors (LEAP) scholar; and earned the School of Chemical Sciences’ Teaching Excellence Award.
