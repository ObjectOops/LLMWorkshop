BiographyDavid Ehrhardt’s academic research a the University of Wisconsin-Madison focused on novel methods of model calibration for prediction of structural responses from extreme loading.  His dissertation centered on the use of nonlinear normal modes as an optimization feature to match experimental data with numerical prediction so updated models could be used to predict the nonlinear static and dynamic response from extreme acoustic/thermal/mechanical loading. His postdoctoral research at the University of Bristol used the tools from his dissertation for the experimental and numerical prediction of nonlinear normal modes to design a structure exhibiting unique nonlinear behavior. Using these tools, he was able to design a structure with variable nonlinear coupling with a focus on 1-1 and 1-3 coupling. This work was the first to identify a detached nonlinear normal mode experimentally, analytically, and numerically in the same structure. His continuing research at the Air Force Research Lab focuses on the experimental measurement of structures in combined acoustic/thermal/mechanical loading. This work is centered on a flexible panels under extreme mechanical/thermal excitation with additional fluid-thermal-structural interaction work in Mach 2, Mach 4 and Mach 6 wind-tunnels. Using novel optical measurement techniques, he was able to measure the static/dynamic structural response in addition to the thermal state of thin panels in these environments.In 2021, he joined the Applied Research Institute at the University of Illinois and was simultaneously appointed the Lab Coordinator of the Advanced Material Testing and Evaluation Laboratory.
